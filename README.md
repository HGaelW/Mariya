A Machine-Learning powered chat-bot that tells Kinyarwanda Jokes

this app will have jokes already in the dataset and it will randomize them to the user.
however it will ask back the user for jokes in return and then record those jokes in the dataset which allows it to tell them to other users too.

i need to allow it not to tell the joke to someone who added it (user's account would be needed)

*to install the app*
1. start by creating a directory
2. install a virtual env
3. install flask
4. clone this repository into that directory
5. run pip install -r requirements.txt #this is to install all the dependencies

now you have the app ready!
